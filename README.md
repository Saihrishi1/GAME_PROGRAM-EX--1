### Name : Sai Hrishi M
### Reg No : 212224240140

## Aim :

To create a basic material with emissive, roughness and metallic preperties and add it to a mesh.

## Software Required :

1. Unreal Engine - v5.3 or v5.5

## Procedure :

1. Create a material on the content browser, rename it to MyMaterial and edit the material graph.

2. Add a Constant3Vetor Node on the material graph and connect it to the Base Color on the Mesh Node, give values to each vector (X,Y,Z) of the Constant3Vector Node.

3. Create a Scalar Paramter Node and Rename it as Metallic, give values to the node and connect it to Metallic Properties on the Mesh Node.

4. Create a Scalar Paramter Node and Rename it as Roughness, give values to the node and connect it to Roughness Properties on the Mesh Node.

5. Create a Scalar Paramter Node and Rename it as Emissive, give values to the node and connect it to Emissive Properties on the Mesh Node.
